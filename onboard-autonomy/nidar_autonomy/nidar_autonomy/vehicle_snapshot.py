"""A plain, rclpy-free snapshot of the vehicle state a mission decides on
-- produced by ardupilot_vehicle.ArduCopterVehicle.snapshot(), consumed
by mission logic (e.g. missions/hover/hover_logic.py) so that logic is
unit-testable without ROS. Ages are seconds since the last message;
None means "never received" -- missions must treat that as unknown, not
as a default value."""
