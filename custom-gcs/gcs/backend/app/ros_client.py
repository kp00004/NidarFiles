"""Owns the single connection to rosbridge and caches the latest value per
topic. This is the hardware-isolation seam on the backend side: every
route in app/main.py only ever calls `latest()` / `survivors()` /
`publish_command()` on this class -- pointing at the real Jetson instead
of sim/rosbridge_sim is a Settings change (app/config.py), not a change
to anything that touches roslibpy directly.

Threading note: roslibpy runs its own connection thread (via Twisted),
independent of FastAPI/uvicorn's asyncio event loop. Subscription
callbacks fire on that thread, so the cache is protected by a plain lock
rather than assuming any particular event loop.
