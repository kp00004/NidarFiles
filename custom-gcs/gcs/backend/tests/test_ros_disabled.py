"""ROS-optional local-development mode -- GCS_ROS_ENABLED=false (see
app/config.py's Settings.ros_enabled and app/ros_client.py's
DisabledRosBridgeClient). Covers the scenario this mode exists for: a
developer with no Jetson, no ROS, no rosbridge at all (e.g. a Windows
laptop) needs the FastAPI backend to start, mission/scenario metadata to
be inspectable, and ROS-dependent reads/writes to degrade honestly
instead of crashing the app or faking success.

Uses `create_app(settings=...)` with `client=None` throughout (not
`client=<fake>`) specifically so create_app()'s own client-selection
logic (real RosBridgeClient vs. DisabledRosBridgeClient, based on
settings.ros_enabled) is what's under test, and `with TestClient(app) as
client:` so the real lifespan (startup/shutdown) runs -- this is the
exact code path that used to crash at startup (roslibpy.RosTimeoutError
propagating out of an unconditional ros_client.connect()) before this
mode existed.
